# WLED-PCB
I Am A Complete Beginner to PCB Design. This is my first project and i have not tested it. I wanted to make a PCB for easily connecting a ESP8266 with WLED installed on it to a light strip and a power supply. Buy This at your own risk. i may have gotten something wrong in the design process.
